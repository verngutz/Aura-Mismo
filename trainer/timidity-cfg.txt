NAME
     timidity.cfg - configure file of TiMidity++


SYNOPSIS
     /usr/local/lib/timidity/timidity.cfg (UNIX)
     C:\TIMIDITY\TIMIDITY.CFG (Windows)


DESCRIPTION
     The file timidity.cfg describes the runtime environments  of
     timidity(1)  that  are  the  path of sound font, instruments
     configrations or else.
     TiMidity looks for the configuration  file  timidity.cfg  at
     startup,  before  processing any options.  If  it  can't  be
     accessed, and the library path is changed with a  -L  option
     on  the  command line, then the default file will be  sought
     again  along  the  new  library  path after  processing  all
     options,  unless  another configuration file  was  specified
     with the -c option.

     Configuration files define the mapping of MIDI  programs  to
     instrument  files.  Multiple  files  may  be  specified, and
     statements in later ones will override earlier ones.



FORMAT
     Following statements can be used in a configuration file:


     dir directory
          Adds directory to the search path in the same manner as
          the  -L  command  line  option.   


     source file
          Reads  another   configuration   file,  then  continues
          processing the current one.


     bank number
          Selects the tone bank  to   modify.    Patch   mappings
          that follow will affect this tone bank.


     progbase number
          Sets and  displays  the  tone  number  from  number  to
          number+128.  If  progbase 1 are specified, tone numbers
          that follow are setted and  displayed  as  the  numbers
          from 1 to 128.


     drumset number
          Selects  the  drum  set   to  modify.   Patch  mappings
          that follow will affect this drum set.


     number file [options]
          Specifies that the  the  MIDI  program  number  in  the
          current  tone  bank  or drum set should be played using
          the patch file. options may be any of the following:


          amp=amplification
               Amplifies the instrument's volume by amplification
               percent.  If  no  value  is specified, one will be
               automatically determined whenever  the  instrument
               is loaded.


          note=note
               Specifies a fixed  MIDI  note  to  use  when play-
               ing   the   instrument.  If note is 0, the instru-
               ment will be played at  whatever  note  the   Note
               On   event   triggering  it  has.  For  percussion
               instruments, if no value is specified in the  con-
               figuration  file,  the  default  in the patch file
               will be used.


          pan=panning
               Sets the instrument's default panning. panning may
               be  left, right, center, or an nteger between -100
               and  100,  designating full  left  and full  right
               respectively.   If  no  value  is  specified,  the
               default  in  the patch  file will be  used.   Note
               that  panning  controls in MIDI files  will  over-
               ride  this value.


          keep={loop|env}
               By default, percussion instruments have their loop
               and   envelope   information  stripped.  Strangely
               shaped envelopes are  removed  automatically  from
               melodic  instruments as  well. keep can be used to
               prevent stripping  envelope  or  loop  data.   For
               example,  the  Short  and  Long Whistle percussion
               instruments (General Midi numbers 71 and 72)  need
               to have `keep=loop keep=env' specified in the con-
               figuration file.


          strip={loop|env|tail}
               Force removal of loop or envelope information from
               all  patches in the instrument, or strip the tail,
               i.e. all data after the  loop.   Some  third-party
               instruments  have  garbage after the loop, as evi-
               denced by  a clicking noise whenever  the  instru-
               ment  is  played,  so adding the strip=tail option
               will markedly improve sound quality.

     The following statements are available only latest TiMidity.


     #extension altassign program1 program2 ...
          Sets the alternate assign for drum set.   For  example,
          if  you  want  to pronounce Hi-Hat cymbals (note number
          42/44/46) in the drumset 0 exclusively to each  others,
          specify:

          drumset 0
          altassign 42 44 46

          Note that alternate assign of  drumset  0  is  used  by
          default.


     #extension comm program secound
          Specifies the comment comment for the tone number  pro-
          gram.   These  comments  are displayed in the indicater
          line at the case TiMidity is booted with  option  -iNt,
          -iTt.


     #extension timeout program secound
          Specifies the time-out value of  the  program.  If  any
          notes  pronounced  with  the  tone  number  program are
          suspended more than second seconds, TiMidity kills  the
          notes.


     #extension copydrumset drumset
          Copies all settings of the drumset to the current drum-
          set.


     #extension copybank bank
          Copies all settings of the bank to the current bank.


     #extension HTTPproxy hostname:port
          Specifies the proxy of the HTTP protocol. hostname  and
          port are of the proxy host's.


     #extension FTPproxy hostname:port
          Specifies the prox of the FTP protocol. Same as HTTP.


     #extension mailaddr your-mail-address
          Specifies user's mail address. This address  is  sended
          to the FTP server if TiMidity access any file via FTp.


     #extension [-]{option} [optarg]
          Sets the value of boot-time options.


     #extension undef progno
          Undefine the tone progno of current tone bank.

     These "#extension" statements are beginning  with  character
     '#' that is the comment flag of old TiMidity(version 0.2i or
     earlier).  So these statememts are treated as comment line.
     The latest TiMidity treats "#extension" as  white-space.  So
     you can omit it.


     If any file-name expression ended with character '|'  (Ascii
     0x7c),  the  file-name  is treated as command and outputs of
     the command are also examined as arguments of statements.
